# NCAA-Division-I-Academic-Performance
I completed this project in my practicum in data science (DATA 360) course at Augustana College. The goal of the project was to gain experience in visualizing and telling stories with large data sets. The data set used was found at Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/ncaa/academic-scores). The dataset displays the APR (http://www.ncaa.org/about/what-apr), retention rate and eligibility percentage for each sport for each NCAA Division I institution from 2004 to 2014.
